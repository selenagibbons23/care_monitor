# Project Name: Care Monitor
#### Student Name: Selena Gibbons  Student ID: 15570167
 The objective of this project is to create a Smart Care Room Monitoring System with Arduino IoT technology. This system will use sensors to monitor crucial parameters, such as temperature, humidity, pressure,smoke and motion detection. Using Arduino IoT, caregivers can access real-time data through a user-friendly with us of Blynk platform. This platform guarantees reliability and connectivity, enabling parents or caregivers to receive immediate updates and alerts to create a safe environment for individuals. 

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment
The system diagram as below demonstrates the sensors, it contains 2 external sensors one is PIR and the other is a smoke sensor. PIR detects movement through infrared rays from body heat. Smoke sensor can detect CO,lgp based on changes in the conductivity. PIR sensor is connected to A6 pin and the smoke sensor is connected according to the table below.
